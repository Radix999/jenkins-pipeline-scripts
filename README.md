# jenkins-pipeline-scripts

I've been learning Jenkins pipeline scripts recently and found it was lacking examples for the kinds of things I wanted to do, so here's a repository with what I've come up with for all to share.  Feel free to use this as a basis for starting your own nightly build script and let me know if you find it useful at all :)
